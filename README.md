## 🎯 Overview

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) demonstrates exceptional rendering capabilities for novel view synthesis; however, its reconstruction quality degrades significantly under blur-related degradations such as motion blur and defocus artifacts. Existing approaches often rely on computationally intensive implicit neural representations or employ degradation models that fail to adequately capture the complex spatial characteristics of real-world blur.

**PhysMamba-3DGS** is a novel framework that integrates state space modeling with physical priors to achieve robust 3D reconstruction from blurry images. Our method introduces two key innovations:

- **🧠 Depth-aware Mamba-Transformer Hybrid Architecture**: Models long-range dependencies with linear complexity
- **⚡ Hybrid Physical Enhancement Mechanism**: Jointly optimizes motion blur and defocus kernels within the 3DGS pipeline
